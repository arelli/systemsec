PERSONAL INFO
	This is the 3rd excersise/project in the class of Systems Security, in Technical University of Crete, 2021.
	Student: Antonios Rafail Ellinitakis, 2017030118

SYNOPSIS
	The assignment pdf asked us to create a wrapper function for fopen() and fwrite() functions in C, that will
	intercept certain things about the callee and store them in a log file. These things are:
	
	- name/path of the file
		In my case, the whole path was used for portability

	- uid(user ID)
		The uid of the calling task

	- MD5 checksum
		 The checksum of the file before and after the operation

	- Date/time 
		The exact timestamp the operation occured. 

	- Access type
		To know ehwn it was simple file creation, when it was existing file opening, or writing into an existing file.

	- If the operation was denied
		A simple boolean flag that shows if the write/open operation was allowed by the OS. 
	
	With all these in hand, we can check for data breaches in our system, supposing that the interceptor functions are 
	enforced by default.

IMPLEMENTATION
	The implementation is divided in three parts. Each one serves a purpose, and they must all be completed in order
	for the whole demonstration to work smoothly.
		
	- logger.c
		This file is the backbone of the demo. It contains the wrapper functions for fopen() and fwrite() we created,
		and creates the produced-by-gcc shared object libray file, logger.so, that is fed to LD_PRELOAD during testing.
		One of the main issues with implementing this, was the MD5 checksum production, because it needs cooperation 
		with the openssl library(which is notoriously not so beginner friendly documented) and calls to the original
		fopen()(not the wrapped one we offer!). A new function get_md5_from_path() was created, that takes the file path,
		and returns the checksum in a string. Inside this function, a new fopen() call occurs, even if we already have
		the same file open on another stream. This is because the other stream may be "w"(write-only mode), and this 
		would not allow us to read the contents and produce the hash. An importand role in this process is played by 
		fflush(), which writes the contents of the external fwrite() to the file, and then lets us use our standard
		md5 function, and read the file *after* the changes have been made. Other data acquisition methods were 
		implemented in a function, such as get_time().Also, the log output was initially placed in the /tmp/ folder, to
		be accessible by all users, but was moved locally in the project folder to make it easier to send it to the 
		class instructors. It is commented in the code though. The function get_path_from_fp() was created, to assist
		in md5 derivation in the case of fwrite(). This is because, in the external fwrite() call we have only the 
		file pointer, and not the whole filepath/filename. Get_path_from_fp() uses fileno() to get the file descriptor
		from the stream, and then we create the link (at /proc/self/fd/[file descriptor]) and feed it to readlink() to
		get the full file path. This only works on Linux-based systems so be careful! 
		In total, the logging works flawlessly, testing for all the required variables.
	-acmonitor.c
		This is the code that parses the log file, and provides a user interface to check on some info.
